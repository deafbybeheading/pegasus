An ActionScript 3 driver for the PostgreSQL open source database.

Pegasus currently supports both the simple and extended query
protocols, clear-text password and trust authentication, and the
PostgreSQL notification mechanism (LISTEN/NOTIFY). It has an
extensible data type handling system with built-in support for the
most common types (Date, Number, int, Boolean, and String in
ActionScript, and their PostgreSQL equivalents).

The pegasus core library does not have any external dependencies,
although as3crypto is likely to be introduced for SSL support. It can
be used in any AS3-based .swf, such as plain Flash stand-alone
applications, Flash web applications, and Flex or AIR applications
(albeit the Flash cross-domain policies will prevent you from doing
anything too colorful from a web app).

The pegasus repository includes pgconsole, a simple AIR application
which can connect to a PostgreSQL server, issue queries, and display
results. It also supports notifications.

More features (especially more data types and additional
authentication mechanisms) are in progress.
