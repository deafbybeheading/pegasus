An ActionScript 3 driver for the PostgreSQL open source database.

Currently supports only the simple query protocol (no parameters),
clear-text password (and trust) authentication, integer datetimes,
Unicode encoding, and char, varchar, text, int2, int4 and timestamp /
timestamptz output. Also, the error handling is a little shaky,
especially with respect to dropped connections.

More features (especially more data types, md5 auth, and more solid
error handling) are in progress.
