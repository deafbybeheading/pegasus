An ActionScript 3 driver for the PostgreSQL open source database.

Currently supports only the simple query protocol (no parameters),
clear-text password (and trust) authentication. Limited to integer
datetimes and Unicode encoding. Only supported output types are
currently char, varchar, text, int2, int4, float4, float8, timestamp,
and timestamptz. Also, the error handling is a little shaky,
especially with respect to dropped connections.

More features (especially more data types, md5 auth, and more solid
error handling) are in progress.
